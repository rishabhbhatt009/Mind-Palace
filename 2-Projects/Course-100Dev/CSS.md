Cascading Style Sheet 

---
Level 1 : Basics 
- selector, property, value 
- Including style : inline style, style tag, external style sheet (link). Precedence is in reverse order, what ever is applied last is what you finally see (inline will always have highest).
- Selectors : universal (`*`), element, class (`.`), id (`#`)
- Properties : 
	- color properties : color (foreground), background-color, 
	- color systems : `RGB`, `HEX`, (`0-255=00-FF`)
	- text properties : text-align (left, right, center, start, end), text-decoration (none, underline, overline, line-through), font-weight (100-900, normal, bold=400, bolder, lighter), font-family (fall back mechanism), 
	- units : absolute units (pixel 1inch = 96px), relative units
