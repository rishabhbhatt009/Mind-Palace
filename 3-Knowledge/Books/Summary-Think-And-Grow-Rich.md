9th Step : The Master Mind 

- **POWER** = organized and intelligently directed knowledge
- **Source of knowledge** : Infinite intelligence, Accumulated experience and Experiment and research. Once knowledge is acquired it can be converted into power by organizing it into definite plans and expressing those plans by actions 
- Desire can be converted to riches with a plan and **power**
- Gaining power through Master Mind **(Battery Metaphor)** : similar to how a group of batteries connected together give more power, a group of minds working together in harmony generate more power
- Two sides of MM principle : economic and physic 
- **Stream of power** : two way stream~ thinking process
- While the author tells us why Master Mind is important, he does not talk about : how to assemble this master mind ? how to maintain and filter people for master mind ? 
- Examples : 
	- Henry Ford, Franklin Roosevelt, Gandhi  
	- Andrew Grove (Intel) 
	- Ross Perot (Electronic Data Systems)

	- after 40, people (not all) learn to use will power to direct this energy to their work **(SEX TRANSMUTATIOBN)**
	- sex is a powerful emotion, similar to chemicals when emotions are mixed together they assume different properties which have different effects
