# The Four Agreements

The author talks about 4 agreements 

---
Your words should be impeccable 

- words are powerful ! they can cast a spell on people
- be nice and polite not just to others but yourself as well 
- do what you say

---
Don't take anything personally 

- other's opinion about you (good or bad) has got nothing to do with you
- their opinion is a reflection of them
- never engage in gossip (don't talk about people behind their back - code of loyalty)
- don't make their emotional garbage yours

---
Don't make assumptions 

- always ask questions and clarify 
- we are humans, but when you do always make positive assumptions

---
Give your best every time 

- give your best every time, it might not be the very best but you will improve
- with incremental efforts you will slowly **improve your worst / baseline every time**
