# Time and Space Complexity 

In Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), there are several common time complexities that are used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm. 

![Time Complexity](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/9b2ba6ec-583e-4be4-b344-214cb45a17bb)

Here are some of them: 
- Constant Time: O(1)
- Logarithmic Time: O(log n)
- Linear Time: O(n)
- Linear Logarithmic Time: O(n log n)
- Quadratic Time: O(n^2)
- Cubic Time: O(n^3)
- Exponential Time: O(2^n)
- Factorial Time: O(n!)
