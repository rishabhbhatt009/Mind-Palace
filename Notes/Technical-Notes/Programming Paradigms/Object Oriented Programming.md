# Objected Oriented Programming

Principles of OOP : 
- these are fundamental concepts that guide the OOP approach in software development.
- These principles help create software that is modular, reusable, and easy to maintain. 

The four main principles of OOP :

1. **Encapsulation** : 
	- This principle involves bundling/combining the *data* (attributes) and the *methods* (functions or procedures) that operate on the data into a single unit (class)
	- It also involves *restricting direct access* to some of an object’s components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the data. The object *exposes a public interface* for other objects to interact with, which helps to reduce system complexity and increases robustness.

2. **Abstraction**: 
	- Hide the details/complexity away 
	- Abstraction means creating simple models of complex reality by ignoring the irrelevant details and only focusing on aspects that are necessary for the purpose. 
	- This principle helps in managing complexity by allowing the programmer to deal with the level of detail that is most appropriate to a certain task. It also helps to reduce programming effort and increase program comprehensibility.

3. **Inheritance**: 
	- This principle allows a new class to *inherit the properties and methods* of an existing class. Inheritance *promotes reusability*. 
	- A *subclass* can extend or override the behavior of a *superclass*. This means that you can create a general class first then later create more specialized classes that incorporate the general class's data and behavior.

4. **Polymorphism**: 
	- Polymorphism allows for the use of a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types). 
	- Through polymorphism, a single function or method *can work/behaves in different ways depending on the object it is acting upon*. 
	- This means objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass; the specific method that is called is determined dynamically at runtime based on the actual object’s class.
