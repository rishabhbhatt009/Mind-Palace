# Programming paradigms

Programming paradigms are ways to classify programming languages based on their features and style of programming.

---
- **Imperative Programming** : Focuses on describing how a program operates. It consists of commands for the computer to perform actions. The programmer instructs the machine step by step. Example: `C` and `Python` are imperative languages. For instance, a loop in C to print numbers from 1 to 10 is an example of imperative programming.

- **Procedural Programming** : A type of imperative programming that uses procedures or functions to organize code. It's centered around the concept of procedure calls. Example: `C` is also a procedural language. Writing a function to calculate the factorial of a number illustrates procedural programming.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes), and code, in the form of procedures (methods). Example: `Java` and `Python` support OOP. Creating a Car class with attributes like speed and color, and methods like accelerate() or brake() is an example.

- **Declarative Programming** : Focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying how to achieve it. The code describes the logic of the computation without describing its control flow. Example: `SQL` for database queries is declarative. You describe what data you want, not how to fetch it.

- **Functional Programming** : Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. Example: `Haskell` is a functional language. A simple function to compute the nth Fibonacci number in Haskell exemplifies functional programming.

- **Logic Programming** : Based on formal logic. A program consists of a set of facts and rules which tell the computer what to do. Example: `Prolog`. Writing a rule to find a relationship between two people in a family tree is a logic programming example.

---
- **Event-Driven Programming** : Mainly used in developing graphical user interfaces where the program responds to various events or inputs. Example: `JavaScript` used in web development. Functions are written to handle events like mouse clicks or key presses.

- **Concurrent Programming** : Involves writing programs that execute multiple operations simultaneously, such as in multi-core processors. Example: `Java` and `Python` support concurrent programming. Writing a multi-threaded server that handles multiple client requests simultaneously is an example.
