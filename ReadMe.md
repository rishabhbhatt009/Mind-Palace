# ReadMe : Mind Palace

Simple rules and though to keep my mind sane : 
- Keep it simple 
- Write from memory based on your understanding. Do not copy !

## Workflow Design

- all notes first go to `Fleeting-Notes` from where they are moved actual location. This keeps the focus on note and its content rather than placement 
- main page : `_Folder-Name` 
- file/folder Name : No spaces each work capital (Titles)
- 
- Technology Notes : 
	- remember you are writing notes not code 
	- create a separate note for code snippets

- Book Notes : 
	- write, do not copy !
	- write a summary, keep things concise 
	- divide into sections / chapters 

## Documentations
